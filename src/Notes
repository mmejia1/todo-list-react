-in order to use "useEffect" with async, put async in a function and call it in use effect.

-In this project using axios to make calls to the back end

-In this project using react hooks with functional comonents

-added a onDoubleClick functionto for each todo

-added a clearcomplete function that would handle deliting all completed tasl


## Code notes, could have probably worked on a axios call that would take care of content and isDone changes
   Could use some more design work like adding the circle around check mark
